5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
The box model is the hierarchy of structure that all CSS elements follow. It is: margin, border, padding, content with content being the innermost element of the box model when graphically drawn.
The fix for the box model is that the width of all elements must add up to total the desired width. If a desired width is 500px, then the right and left margin, right and left border width, right and left padding width, and width of the content must all add up to equal 500px.
